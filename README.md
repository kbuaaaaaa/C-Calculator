# C Calculator
 
My programming project. This is a calculator with algebraic equation solving, graphing function (which works in a bit of a weird way). My 1st year self decided to challenge myself and do it all in C, with no external libraries. Everything is in main.c (red flag, I know). Please note that I no longer code like this.
